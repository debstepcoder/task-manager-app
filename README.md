# Task Manager React App

## Overview

This is a simple React application that demonstrates the use of Redux for state management. It includes a theme switcher and a basic task manager with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

## Features

- **Theme Switcher**: Allows users to switch between light and dark themes, with theme preferences saved in Redux for persistence.

- **Task Manager**: Users can add new tasks with titles and descriptions, view a list of all tasks, and perform operations like editing and deleting tasks. Task status can be filtered (All, Completed, Pending).

- **Redux State Management**: Utilizes Redux to manage both the theme and task-related states.

- **Custom Hooks**: Implements custom hooks for various functionalities, enhancing code reusability and readability.

- **Responsive Design**: Designed to work well on both desktop and mobile devices.
